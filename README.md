# YesTicket Custom

Custom Version of [YesTicket's Wordpress Plugin](https://www.yesticket.org/login/de/integration.php#wp-plugin).

## Why?

* Need event images, when using the event_shortcode
* Need to filter events by their name (done via str_contains())
* Need proper styling when displaying a single event (when count="1")

## Installation

Zip all files inside the `yesticket` folder. (The resulting ZIP should contain the files directly)

Then follow along with the original's install instructions, just use our own freshly packed ZIP as basis.

Eg:
1. In your Wordpress go to `Plugins > Install`.
2. Select the freshly packed ZIP archive.
3. Activate plugin
4. Use the shortcodes...
